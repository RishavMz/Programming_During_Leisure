template.cpp => A custom template made by me for ease of coding competitions while using C++

###

The following are proofs (According to me) , that Competitive programming is not about a particular language , some selected topics , or that questions which would only be solved if the topic is taught.
#
Insted, In my opinion, Competitve programming is a sport, and each question is a puzzle, which is to be solved. It does not matter whether you have learnt about the topic in school or college, or whether you are from CS background or not, If you think hard and kindle the flame of your mighty brain to hunt for a possible solution to the puzzle, then you would surely be able to solve the problem.

Okay, enough of philosophy, lets get started...
